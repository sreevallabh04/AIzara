Make Zara a fully autonomous, multimodal desktop assistant with voice, vision, memory, and tool execution using the local Ollama LLaMA 3.2 model. Use the existing modular codebase (zara/main.py, agent.py, tools.py, vision.py, memory.py) and follow these goals:

🧠 1. Local LLM Integration

Ensure the agent uses the local Ollama model (llama3.2) via the Python client, no Gemini API.

All conversations and function calls should be routed through this local LLM.

Maintain conversation history using SQLite (as already implemented).

🎙️ 2. Conversational Agent & Function Calling

Use LangChain or a lightweight custom implementation to allow natural language commands to trigger tools (functions).

Examples:

“Send an email to John saying I’m on the way.” → send_email(to="John", content="I'm on the way.")

“Open WhatsApp and message Mom: 'Call me now'.” → send_whatsapp_message(contact="Mom", message="Call me now")

🧰 3. Tools & Desktop Control

Implement or complete the following tools in tools.py:

open_whatsapp_desktop() → Use pygetwindow + pyautogui or pywinauto to activate the native app.

send_whatsapp_message(contact, message) → Types and sends the message.

search_google(query), open_file(path), play_music(), etc.

👁️ 4. Real-Time Computer Vision

Finish vision.py with object detection using MobileNet SSD.

Add describe_camera_scene() tool that:

Captures a webcam frame

Runs object detection

Returns and speaks a summary (e.g., “I see a person, laptop, and cup.”)

🗃️ 5. Memory Expansion (Optional)

Add long-term memory via SQLite or JSON:

Store user preferences, contacts, and notes.

Sample commands: “Remember my Wi-Fi password is xyz123.” or “What did I say yesterday?”

🔄 6. Continuous Mode (Optional Power Feature)

Allow a continuous listening mode using threading.

On “Zara, activate assistant mode”, continuously listen, respond, and act.

🧪 7. Testing & TTS

Ensure text-to-speech works via pyttsx3.

Validate the agent’s response flow: mic input → LLM reasoning → tool execution → TTS output.

📁 Project Context

Use the project already structured with:

main.py (entry point)

agent.py (LLM + LangChain)

tools.py (email, web, WhatsApp, etc.)

vision.py (camera tools)

memory.py (conversation DB)

Target: Make Zara feel like a local Jarvis with full desktop access, vision, and tools — all powered offline.

Let me know if you need mock functions, UI integration, or a fast mode using keyboard shortcuts.
