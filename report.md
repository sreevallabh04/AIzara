# Zara Assistant: Current Setup Report

## üîç Understanding Your Current Setup

### üß† 1. Gemini Integration
- **How are you currently using the Gemini API?**
  - **Natural language understanding**: Yes, for generating responses to user queries.
  - **Conversation/memory**: Yes, stores conversation history in SQLite DB.
  - **Agent-style tool routing**: Not explicitly implemented yet.

- **Gemini-related code (API call part) from main.py:**
  ```python
  def get_ai_response(query):
      if not gemini_api_key:
          return "Gemini API key is not set. Please set the API key."
      try:
          system_prompt = {"role": "system", "content": "You are Zara, a helpful, safe, and conversational AI assistant. Always respond as Zara."}
          history = load_recent_conversation(10)
          context = [system_prompt] + [{"role": r, "content": c} for r, c in history] + [{"role": "user", "content": query}]
          model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
          response = model.generate_content(context)
          save_conversation("user", query)
          save_conversation("assistant", response.text)
          return response.text
      except Exception as e:
          return "I'm having trouble connecting to my knowledge base right now."
  ```

### üó£Ô∏è 2. Speech Input & TTS
- **Are you using speech_recognition and pyttsx3, or something else?**
  - **Speech Input**: `speech_recognition` for listening to commands.
  - **TTS**: `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech output.

- **Is it continuous listening or press-to-speak?**
  - **Press-to-speak**: Zara listens for a command after the trigger word "zara" is detected.

- **Function or file where Zara listens and responds:**
  ```python
  def take_command(trigger_word_active=True):
      command = ""
      try:
          with sr.Microphone() as source:
              print("Listening...")
              listener.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source, duration=1)
              voice = listener.listen(source, timeout=10, phrase_time_limit=10)
              command = listener.recognize_google(voice).lower()
              if trigger_word_active and "zara" in command:
                  command = command.replace("zara", "").strip()
              print(f"Command: {command}")
      except sr.UnknownValueError:
          print("Could not understand the audio.")
      except sr.RequestError as e:
          print(f"Request error: {e}")
      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Error: {e}")
      return command
  ```

### üéØ 3. Tasks Handled
- **Which of these are already working?**
  - **Object detection via webcam**: Yes, using OpenCV and MobileNet SSD.
  - **Voice command understanding**: Yes, using `speech_recognition`.
  - **WhatsApp messaging via web**: Yes, opens WhatsApp web using `webbrowser.open('https://web.whatsapp.com')`.
  - **Sending emails**: Yes, using `smtplib`.
  - **File/folder operations**: Yes, using `os` module.
  - **Real-time summarization (e.g. meetings)**: Not yet implemented.
  - **Wikipedia / search lookup**: Yes, using `wikipedia` and `pywhatkit`.
  - **Language translation**: Yes, using `googletrans`.
  - **Safety moderation**: Yes, using a simple banned words list.

### üíª 4. WhatsApp Control
- **You mentioned WhatsApp Web ‚Äî does Zara already open and interact with it?**
  - **Yes**, Zara opens WhatsApp web using `webbrowser.open('https://web.whatsapp.com')`.

- **If yes, does it use pyautogui, selenium, or browser automation?**
  - **Browser automation**: Uses `webbrowser` module to open the URL.

- **If not yet implemented, should this be native desktop app control or web-based?**
  - **Web-based**: Currently implemented as web-based. Native desktop app control can be added if desired.

### üß± 5. Modularization
- **Is all the code currently inside main.py or already separated into modules?**
  - **All code is currently inside main.py**.

- **Do you want help organizing this into modules?**
  - **Yes**, organizing into modules like `vision.py`, `agent.py`, `tools.py`, `voice.py`, and `memory.py` would improve maintainability.

### üóÉÔ∏è 6. DB Usage
- **What kind of data is being stored in zara_assistant.db?**
  - **Conversation history**: Stored in the `conversation_history` table.
  - **User data**: Stored in the `user_data` table.

- **Schema or queries:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS conversation_history (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
      role TEXT,
      content TEXT,
      timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  );

  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_data (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
      key TEXT,
      value TEXT
  );
  ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è 7. Current Flow
- **Can you describe what happens step-by-step when you run main.py and say something like "What is the weather today?" or "Describe what's in front of the camera"?**
  - **Step 1**: Zara listens for the trigger word "zara".
  - **Step 2**: Once triggered, Zara listens for the command.
  - **Step 3**: The command is processed:
    - If it's a weather query, Zara calls `get_weather(city_name)` to fetch and announce the weather.
    - If it's a camera command, Zara captures an image using `capture_camera_image()` and describes it using `describe_camera_image()`.
  - **Step 4**: Zara responds using TTS (`talk(text)`).

## Next Steps
- **Prioritize Features**: Decide which innovations align best with your vision and user needs.
- **Prototype & Test**: Build quick prototypes of key features and gather user feedback.
- **Iterate & Scale**: Continuously improve based on feedback and scale up successful features.
